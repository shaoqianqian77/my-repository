# 应对个人偏狭视角的好问题

Good questions to ask to combat this reality are:  
为应对这一现实而提出的好问题是：

> What haven’t I experienced firsthand that leaves me naive to how something works?  
> 
> 有什么是我没有亲身经历过的，使我对某些东西的运作方式感到天真？
>
> Which of my current views would I disagree with if I were born in a different country or generation?  
> 
> 如果我出生在不同的国家或年代，我现在的哪些观点会不同意？
>
> What do I desperately want to be true, so much that I think it’s true when it’s clearly not?  
> 
> 我急切地希望什么是真的，以至于我认为它是真的，但它显然不是？
>
> Which of my current views would change if my incentives were different?  
> 
> 如果我的激励措施不同，我目前的哪些观点会改变？

But an even better skill is realizing that everyone else struggles with those questions and winces at the potential answers.  

但一个更好的技能是意识到其他人都在为这些问题挣扎，并对潜在的答案感到害怕。

You don’t have to agree with others’ delusions or put up with their collateral damage. Just accepting that everyone wants easy and comforting answers in a complex and painful world is a rare skill.  

你不必同意别人的妄想，也不必忍受他们的连带伤害。只要接受在一个复杂而痛苦的世界中，每个人都想要简单而舒适的答案，就是一种难得的技能。
