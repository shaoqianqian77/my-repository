> Silicon Valley’s most successful tech companies use the insights of behaviour design to pump us with dopamine and keep us returning to their products. But, as Ian Leslie learns, some of the psychologists who developed the science of persuasion are worried about the way it is being used

**In 1930, a** psychologist at Harvard University called B.F. Skinner made a box and placed a hungry rat inside it. The box had a lever on one side. As the rat moved about it would accidentally knock the lever and, when it did so, a food pellet would drop into the box. After a rat had been put in the box a few times, it learned to go straight to the lever and press it: the reward reinforced the behaviour. Skinner proposed that the same principle applied to any “operant”, rat or man. He called his device the “operant conditioning chamber”. It became known as the Skinner box.  

1930 年，哈佛大学一位名叫 B.F.斯金纳的心理学家做了一个盒子，把一只饥饿的老鼠放在里面。盒子的一侧有一个杠杆。当老鼠走动时，它会不小心撞到杠杆，当它这样做时，一个食物颗粒会掉进盒子里。当老鼠被放进盒子里几次后，它就学会了直接走到杠杆前并按下它：奖励强化了这种行为。斯金纳提出，同样的原则适用于任何 "操作物"，无论是老鼠还是人。他把他的装置称为 "操作性调节室"。它后来被称为斯金纳箱。

Skinner was the most prominent exponent of a school of psychology called behaviourism, the premise of which was that human behaviour is best understood as a function of incentives and rewards. Let’s not get distracted by the nebulous and impossible to observe stuff of thoughts and feelings, said the behaviourists, but focus simply on how the operant’s environment shapes what it does. Understand the box and you understand the behaviour. Design the right box and you can control behaviour.  

斯金纳是一个被称为行为主义的心理学流派的最杰出代表，该流派的前提是，人类行为最好被理解为激励和奖励的功能。行为主义者说，我们不要被那些虚无缥缈的、不可能观察到的思想和感觉所干扰，而要简单地关注操作者的环境如何影响它的行为。了解了盒子，你就了解了行为。设计正确的盒子，你就能控制行为。

Skinner turned out to be the last of the pure behaviourists. From the late 1950s onwards, a new generation of scholars redirected the field of psychology back towards internal mental processes, like memory and emotion. But behaviourism never went away completely, and in recent years it has re-emerged in a new form, as an applied discipline deployed by businesses and governments to influence the choices you make every day: what you buy, who you talk to, what you do at work. Its practitioners are particularly interested in how the digital interface – the box in which we spend most of our time today – can shape human decisions. The name of this young discipline is “behaviour design”. Its founding father is B.J. Fogg.  

斯金纳被证明是最后一位纯粹的行为主义者。从 20 世纪 50 年代末开始，新一代的学者将心理学领域重新导向内部心理过程，如记忆和情感。但行为主义从未完全消失，近年来，它以一种新的形式重新出现，成为一门应用学科，被企业和政府用来影响你每天做出的选择：你买什么，你和谁说话，你在工作中做什么。它的从业者对数字界面--我们今天大部分时间都在这个盒子里--如何塑造人类的决定特别感兴趣。这门年轻的学科的名称是 "行为设计"。它的创始人是 B.J. Fogg。

**Earlier this year** I travelled to Palo Alto to attend a workshop on behaviour design run by Fogg on behalf of his employer, Stanford University. Roaming charges being what they are, I spent a lot of time hooking onto Wi-Fi in coffee bars. The phrase “accept and connect” became so familiar that I started to think of it as a Californian mantra. Accept and connect, accept and connect, accept and connect.  

今年早些时候，我去帕洛阿尔托参加了由 Fogg 代表他的雇主斯坦福大学举办的行为设计研讨会。由于漫游费的存在，我花了很多时间在咖啡馆的 Wi-Fi 上挂机。接受和连接 "这句话变得如此熟悉，以至于我开始把它当作加州的口头禅。接受和连接，接受和连接，接受和连接。

I had never used Uber before, and since I figured there is no better place on Earth to try it out, I opened the app in Starbucks one morning and summoned a driver to take me to Stanford’s campus. Within two minutes, my car pulled up, and an engineering student from Oakland whisked me to my destination. I paid without paying. It felt magical. The workshop was attended by 20 or so executives from America, Brazil and Japan, charged with bringing the secrets of behaviour design home to their employers.  

我以前从未使用过 Uber，因为我想地球上没有比这更好的地方可以尝试了，所以一天早上我在星巴克打开了这个应用程序，召唤了一个司机带我去斯坦福大学校园。不到两分钟，我的车就停了下来，一个来自奥克兰的工程学学生把我送到了目的地。我没有付钱。这感觉很神奇。参加研讨会的有来自美国、巴西和日本的 20 多位高管，他们负责将行为设计的秘密带回家给他们的雇主。

Fogg is 53. He travels everywhere with two cuddly toys, a frog and a monkey, which he introduced to the room at the start of the day. Fogg dings a toy xylophone to signal the end of a break or group exercise. Tall, energetic and tirelessly amiable, he frequently punctuates his speech with peppy exclamations such as “awesome” and “amazing”. As an Englishman, I found this full-beam enthusiasm a little disconcerting at first, but after a while, I learned to appreciate it, just as Europeans who move to California eventually cease missing the seasons and become addicted to sunshine. Besides, Fogg was likeable. His toothy grin and nasal delivery made him endearingly nerdy.  

福格今年 53 岁。他带着两个可爱的玩具到处旅行，一只青蛙和一只猴子，他在一天开始的时候就把这两个玩具介绍给大家。福格用玩具木琴叮咚作响，以示休息或集体练习的结束。他身材高大、精力充沛、和蔼可亲，经常用 "真棒 "和 "了不起 "等欢快的感叹词作为演讲的点缀。作为一个英国人，我发现这种全力以赴的热情一开始有点令人不安，但过了一段时间，我学会了欣赏它，就像搬到加利福尼亚的欧洲人最终不再想念四季，而是沉迷于阳光。此外，福格很讨人喜欢。他露齿的笑容和鼻音使他成为令人喜爱的书呆子。

In a phone conversation prior to the workshop, Fogg told me that he read the classics in the course of a master’s degree in the humanities. He never found much in Plato, but strongly identified with Aristotle’s drive to organise and catalogue the world, to see systems and patterns behind the confusion of phenomena. He says that when he read Aristotle’s “Rhetoric”, a treatise on the art of persuasion, “It just struck me, oh my gosh, this stuff is going to be rolled out in tech one day!”  

在研讨会之前的一次电话交谈中，福格告诉我，他在攻读人文科学硕士学位的过程中阅读了经典作品。他从未在柏拉图身上发现什么，但强烈认同亚里士多德组织和编排世界的动力，在混乱的现象背后看到系统和模式。他说，当他读到亚里士多德的 "修辞学"，一篇关于说服艺术的论文时，"我突然想到，哦，我的天哪，这些东西有一天会在技术上得到推广的！"

In 1997, during his final year as a doctoral student, Fogg spoke at a conference in Atlanta on the topic of how computers might be used to influence the behaviour of their users. He noted that “interactive technologies” were no longer just tools for work, but had become part of people’s everyday lives: used to manage finances, study and stay healthy. Yet technologists were still focused on the machines they were making rather than on the humans using those machines. What, asked Fogg, if we could design educational software that persuaded students to study for longer or a financial-management programme that encouraged users to save more? Answering such questions, he argued, required the application of insights from psychology.  

1997 年，在他作为博士生的最后一年，福格在亚特兰大的一次会议上就如何利用计算机来影响其用户的行为这一主题进行了发言。他指出，"互动技术 "不再只是工作的工具，而是成为人们日常生活的一部分：用来管理财务、学习和保持健康。然而，技术专家仍然专注于他们正在制造的机器，而不是使用这些机器的人类。福格问道，如果我们能设计出说服学生延长学习时间的教育软件，或鼓励用户更多储蓄的财务管理程序，会怎样？他认为，回答这些问题需要应用心理学的见解。

Fogg presented the results of a simple experiment he had run at Stanford, which showed that people spent longer on a task if they were working on a computer which they felt had previously been helpful to them. In other words, their interaction with the machine followed the same “rule of reciprocity” that psychologists had identified in social life. The experiment was significant, said Fogg, not so much for its specific finding as for what it implied: that computer applications could be methodically designed to exploit the rules of psychology in order to get people to do things they might not otherwise do. In the paper itself, he added a qualification: “Exactly when and where such persuasion is beneficial and ethical should be the topic of further research and debate.”  

福格介绍了他在斯坦福大学进行的一个简单实验的结果，该实验表明，如果人们在一台他们认为以前对他们有帮助的计算机上工作，他们在一项任务上花费的时间会更长。换句话说，他们与机器的互动遵循了心理学家在社会生活中发现的同样的 "互惠规则"。福格说，这个实验的意义并不在于它的具体发现，而在于它所暗示的内容：计算机应用可以有条不紊地被设计来利用心理学的规则，以便让人们做他们可能不会做的事情。在这篇论文中，他补充了一个条件："究竟何时何地这样的劝说是有益的和道德的，这应该是进一步研究和辩论的主题。"

Fogg called for a new field, sitting at the intersection of computer science and psychology, and proposed a name for it: “captology” (Computers as Persuasive Technologies). Captology later became behaviour design, which is now embedded into the invisible operating system of our everyday lives. The emails that induce you to buy right away, the apps and games that rivet your attention, the online forms that nudge you towards one decision over another: all are designed to hack the human brain and capitalise on its instincts, quirks and flaws. The techniques they use are often crude and blatantly manipulative, but they are getting steadily more refined, and, as they do so, less noticeable.  

福格呼吁建立一个新的领域，位于计算机科学和心理学的交叉点，并为它提出了一个名字："captology"（计算机作为说服性技术）。Captology 后来成为行为设计，现在已经嵌入到我们日常生活的无形操作系统中。诱使你立即购买的电子邮件，吸引你注意力的应用程序和游戏，促使你做出某种决定的在线表格：所有这些都是为了入侵人的大脑，利用其本能、怪癖和缺陷。他们使用的技术往往是粗暴的、公然的操纵，但他们正逐渐变得更加精细，而且，随着他们这样做，越来越不引人注意。

Fogg’s Atlanta talk provoked strong responses from his audience, falling into two groups: either “This is dangerous. It’s like giving people the tools to construct an atomic bomb”; or “This is amazing. It could be worth billions of dollars.”  
福格在亚特兰大的演讲引起了他的听众的强烈反应，分为两类：要么是 "这很危险。这就像给人们提供了制造原子弹的工具"；或者 "这很了不起。它可能价值数十亿美元"。

The second group has certainly been proved right. Fogg has been called “the millionaire maker”. Numerous Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and engineers have passed through his laboratory at Stanford, and some have made themselves wealthy.  

事实证明，第二类人肯定是对的。福格被称为 "百万富翁制造者"。许多硅谷的企业家和工程师都经过他在斯坦福大学的实验室，有些人已经发了财。

Fogg himself has not made millions of dollars from his insights. He stayed at Stanford, and now does little commercial work. He is increasingly troubled by the thought that those who told him his ideas were dangerous may have been on to something.  

福格本人并没有从他的洞察力中赚取数百万美元。他留在斯坦福大学，现在很少做商业工作。他越来越感到不安的是，那些告诉他他的想法是危险的人可能是有道理的。

**At the workshop**, Fogg explained the building blocks of his theory of behaviour change. For somebody to do something – whether it’s buying a car, checking an email, or doing 20 press-ups – three things must happen at once. The person must want to do it, they must be able to, and they must be prompted to do it. A trigger – the prompt for the action – is effective only when the person is highly motivated, or the task is very easy. If the task is hard, people end up frustrated; if they’re not motivated, they get annoyed.  

在研讨会上，福格解释了他的行为改变理论的构成要素。对于某人来说，无论是买车、检查电子邮件，还是做 20 个俯卧撑，都必须同时发生三件事。这个人必须想做，他们必须有能力做，而且必须有人提示他们去做。触发器--行动的提示--只有在人的动机很强，或者任务很容易的情况下才有效。如果任务很难，人们最终会感到沮丧；如果他们没有动力，他们会感到厌烦。

One of Fogg’s current students told me about a prototype speech-therapy program he was helping to modify. Talking to its users, he discovered that parents, who really wanted it to work, found it tricky to navigate – they were frustrated. Their children found it easy to use, but weren’t bothered about doing so – they were merely annoyed. Applying Fogg’s framework helped identify a way forward. Parents would get over the action line if the program was made simpler to use; children if it felt like a game instead of a lesson.  

福格的一个学生告诉我，他正在帮助修改一个语言治疗的原型程序。在与用户的交谈中，他发现那些真正希望它发挥作用的父母发现它很难驾驭--他们感到很沮丧。他们的孩子发现它很容易使用，但对这样做并不感到困扰--他们只是感到恼火。应用福格的框架有助于确定前进的道路。如果程序使用起来更简单，家长就会克服行动路线；如果感觉它像一个游戏而不是一门课程，孩子们就会克服。

Frustration, says Fogg, is usually more fixable than annoyance. When we want people to do something our first instinct is usually to try to increase their motivation – to persuade them. Sometimes this works, but more often than not the best route is to make the behaviour easier. One of Fogg’s maxims is, “You can’t get people to do something they don’t want to do.” A politician who wants people to vote for her makes a speech or goes on TV instead of sending a bus to pick voters up from their homes. The bank advertises the quality of its current account instead of reducing the number of clicks required to open one.  

福格说，挫折感通常比恼怒感更容易解决。当我们希望人们做某件事时，我们的第一直觉通常是试图提高他们的动机--说服他们。有时这很有效，但更多的时候，最好的办法是让行为变得更容易。福格的格言之一是："你不能让人们去做他们不想做的事情"。一个希望人们为她投票的政治家发表演讲或上电视，而不是派一辆巴士去接选民回家。银行宣传其活期账户的质量，而不是减少开设账户所需的点击次数。

When you get to the end of an episode of “House of Cards” on Netflix, the next episode plays automatically unless you tell it to stop. Your motivation is high, because the last episode has left you eager to know what will happen and you are mentally immersed in the world of the show. The level of difficulty is reduced to zero. Actually, less than zero: it is harder to stop than to carry on. Working on the same principle, the British government now “nudges” people into enrolling into workplace pension schemes, by making it the default option rather than presenting it as a choice.  

当你在 Netflix 上看完一集《纸牌屋》时，下一集会自动播放，除非你告诉它停止。你的积极性很高，因为上一集让你急切地想知道会发生什么，你在精神上沉浸在该剧的世界里。困难程度降低到零。事实上，比零还低：停止比继续下去更难。基于同样的原则，英国政府现在 "怂恿 "人们加入工作场所养老金计划，把它作为默认选项，而不是把它作为一种选择。

When motivation is high enough, or a task easy enough, people become responsive to triggers such as the vibration of a phone, Facebook’s red dot, the email from the fashion store featuring a time-limited offer on jumpsuits. The trigger, if it is well designed (or “hot”), finds you at exactly the moment you are most eager to take the action. The most important nine words in behaviour design, says Fogg, are, “Put hot triggers in the path of motivated people.”  

当动机足够高，或者任务足够容易时，人们就会对触发器做出反应，比如手机的振动、Facebook 的红点、时装店发来的关于连衣裙限时优惠的邮件。触发器，如果它设计得好（或 "热"），就会在你最渴望采取行动的时刻找到你。福格说，行为设计中最重要的九个字是："把热点触发器放在有动机的人的路上"。

If you’re triggered to do something you don’t like, you probably won’t return, but if you love it you’ll return repeatedly – and unthinkingly. After my first Uber, I never even thought of getting around Palo Alto any other way. This, says, Fogg, is how brands should design for habits. The more immediate and intense a rush of emotion a person feels the first time they use something, the more likely they are to make it an automatic choice. It’s why airlines bring you a glass of champagne the moment you sink into a business-class seat, and why Apple takes enormous care to ensure that a customer’s first encounter with a new phone feels magical.

如果你被触发去做你不喜欢的事情，你可能不会再回来，但如果你喜欢它，你会反复回来--而且是不假思索地回来。在我第一次使用 Uber 之后，我甚至没有想过要用其他方式在帕洛阿尔托市内穿梭。福格说，这就是品牌应该为习惯而设计的方式。一个人在第一次使用某样东西时感受到的情感越直接、越强烈，他们就越有可能将其作为一种自动选择。这就是为什么航空公司会在你坐进商务舱的那一刻给你送上一杯香槟，也是为什么苹果公司会花大力气确保顾客第一次使用新手机时有神奇的感觉。

Such upfront deliveries of dopamine bond users to products. Consider the way Instagram lets you try 12 different filters on your picture, says Fogg. Sure, there’s a functional benefit: the user has control over their images. But the real transaction is emotional: before you even post anything, you get to feel like an artist. Hence another of Fogg’s principles: “Make people feel successful” or, to rephrase it, “Give them superpowers!”  

这种前期交付的多巴胺使用户与产品紧密相连。考虑一下 Instagram 让你在照片上尝试 12 种不同的滤镜的方式，福格说。当然，这有一个功能上的好处：用户可以控制他们的图片。但真正的交易是情感上的：在你发布任何东西之前，你就能感觉到自己是一个艺术家。因此，福格的另一个原则："让人们感到成功"，或者换个说法，"给他们超能力！"

Fogg took ambivalent satisfaction from the example of Instagram, since he felt distantly responsible for it and perhaps distantly guilty. In 2006, two students in Fogg’s class collaborated on a project called Send the Sunshine. Their insight was that one day mobile phones (this was the pre-smartphone era) would be used to send emotions: if your friend was in a place where the weather wasn’t good and you were standing in sunshine, your phone could prompt you to take a picture and send it to them to cheer them up. One of the two students, Mike Krieger, went on to co-found Instagram, where over 400m users now share sunrises, sunsets and selfies.  

福格从 Instagram 的例子中得到了矛盾的满足，因为他觉得自己对它有遥远的责任，也许还有遥远的罪恶感。2006 年，福格班上的两名学生合作开展了一个名为 "发送阳光 "的项目。他们的见解是，有一天手机（这是前智能手机时代）将被用来发送情感：如果你的朋友在一个天气不好的地方，而你站在阳光下，你的手机可以提示你拍照并发送给他们，让他们高兴起来。两个学生中的一个，迈克-克里格，后来共同创立了 Instagram，现在有超过 4 亿用户在那里分享日出、日落和自拍。

Fogg built his theory in the years before social media conquered the world. Facebook, Instagram and others have raised behaviour design to levels of sophistication he could hardly have envisaged. Social-media apps plumb one of our deepest wells of motivation. The human brain releases pleasurable, habit-forming chemicals in response to social interactions, even to mere simulacra of them, and the hottest triggers are other people: you and your friends or followers are constantly prompting each other to use the service for longer.  
福格在社交媒体征服世界之前的几年里建立了他的理论。Facebook、Instagram 和其他公司已经将行为设计提高到了他难以想象的复杂程度。社交媒体应用程序挖掘了我们最深的动机之井。人类的大脑会对社交互动，甚至仅仅是模拟的社交互动，释放出愉悦的、形成习惯的化学物质，而最热门的触发器是其他人：你和你的朋友或追随者不断促使对方更长时间地使用该服务。

Fogg introduced me to one of his former students, Noelle Moseley, who now consults for technology companies. She told me that she had recently interviewed heavy users of Instagram: young women who cultivated different personas on different social networks. Their aim was to get as many followers as possible – that was their definition of success. Every new follow and every comment delivered an emotional hit. But a life spent chasing hits didn’t feel good. Moseley’s respondents spent all their hours thinking about how to organise their lives in order to take pictures they could post to each persona, which meant they weren’t able to enjoy whatever they were doing, which made them stressed and unhappy. “It was like a sickness,” said Moseley.  

福格把我介绍给他以前的一个学生诺埃尔-莫斯利，她现在为技术公司提供咨询。她告诉我，她最近采访了 Instagram 的大量用户：在不同社交网络上培养不同角色的年轻女性。她们的目标是获得尽可能多的关注者--这是她们对成功的定义。每一个新的追随者和每一条评论都会带来情感上的冲击。但是花时间追逐点击率的生活感觉并不好。莫斯利的受访者花了所有时间考虑如何安排他们的生活，以便拍摄他们可以发布到每个角色的照片，这意味着他们无法享受他们正在做的任何事情，这使他们感到压力和不快乐。"莫斯利说："这就像一种病症。

B.J. Fogg comes from a Mormon family, which has endowed him with his bulletproof geniality and also with a strong need to believe that his work is making the world a better place. The only times during our conversations when his tone darkened were when he considered the misuse of his ideas in the commercial sphere. He worries that companies like Instagram and Facebook are using behaviour design merely to keep consumers in thrall to them. One of his alumni, Nir Eyal, went on to write a successful book, aimed at tech entrepreneurs, called “Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products”.  

B.J.福格来自一个摩门教家庭，这使他具备了弹无虚发的和蔼可亲，同时也有强烈的需求，相信他的工作正在使世界变得更好。在我们的谈话中，唯一一次他的语气变暗的时候是他考虑到他的想法在商业领域被滥用的时候。他担心像 Instagram 和 Facebook 这样的公司只是在利用行为设计来使消费者对他们趋之若鹜。他的一个校友 Nir Eyal 后来成功地写了一本针对科技企业家的书，叫做《Hooked：如何构建形成习惯的产品"。

“I look at some of my former students and I wonder if they’re really trying to make the world better, or just make money,” said Fogg. “What I always wanted to do was un-enslave people from technology.”  

"我看着我以前的一些学生，我想知道他们是真的想让世界变得更好，还是只是想赚钱，"福格说。"我一直想做的是把人们从技术中解放出来。"

**When B.F. Skinner** performed further experiments with his box, he discovered that if the rat got the same reward each time, it pulled the lever only when it was hungry. The way to maximise the number of times the rat pulled the lever was to vary the rewards it received. If it didn’t know whether it was going to get one pellet, or none, or several when it pulled the lever, then it pulled the lever over and over again. It became psychologically hooked. This became known as the principle of variable rewards.  

当 B.F.斯金纳用他的盒子做进一步的实验时，他发现如果老鼠每次都得到同样的奖励，那么它只有在饥饿时才会拉动杠杆。使老鼠拉动杠杆的次数最大化的方法是改变它得到的奖励。如果它不知道当它拉动杠杆时，它是会得到一个颗粒，还是一个也没有，还是几个颗粒，那么它就会一次又一次地拉动杠杆。它就会在心理上着迷。这就是著名的可变奖励原则。

In “Hooked”, Eyal argues that successful digital products incorporate Skinner’s insight. Facebook, Pinterest and others tap into basic human needs for connection, approval and affirmation, and dispense their rewards on a variable schedule. Every time we open Instagram or Snapchat or Tinder, we never know if someone will have liked our photo, or left a comment, or written a funny status update, or dropped us a message. So we keep tapping the red dot, swiping left and scrolling down.  

在 "上钩 "中，Eyal 认为，成功的数字产品包含了 Skinner 的洞察力。脸书、Pinterest 和其他产品挖掘了人类对联系、认可和肯定的基本需求，并在一个可变的时间表上发放其奖励。每次我们打开 Instagram、Snapchat 或 Tinder，我们永远不知道是否有人会喜欢我们的照片，或留下评论，或写下一个有趣的状态更新，或给我们留言。所以我们不断地点击红点，向左滑动并向下滚动。

Eyal has added his own twists to Fogg’s model of behavioural change. “BJ thinks of triggers as external factors,” Eyal told me. “My argument is that the triggers are internal.” An app succeeds, he says, when it meets the user’s most basic emotional needs even before she has become consciously aware of them. “When you’re feeling uncertain, before you ask why you’re uncertain, you Google. When you’re lonely, before you’re even conscious of feeling it, you go to Facebook. Before you know you’re bored, you’re on YouTube. Nothing tells you to do these things. The users trigger themselves.”  

埃亚尔在福格的行为改变模式中加入了自己的曲折。"BJ 认为触发器是外部因素，"Eyal 告诉我。"我的论点是，触发因素是内部的。"他说，当一个应用程序满足了用户最基本的情感需求，甚至在她有意识地意识到这些需求之前，它就成功了。"当你感到不确定时，在你问你为什么不确定之前，你会用谷歌。当你感到孤独的时候，在你还没有意识到这种感觉的时候，你就上了 Facebook。在你知道你很无聊之前，你就上了 YouTube。没有人告诉你要做这些事情。用户是自己触发的"。

Eyal’s emphasis on unthinking choices raises a question about behaviour design. If our behaviours are being designed for us, to whom are the designers responsible? That’s what Tristan Harris, another former student of Fogg’s, wants everyone to think about. “BJ founded the field of behaviour design,” he told me. “But he doesn’t have an answer to the ethics of it. That’s what I’m looking for.”  

Eyal 对不假思索的选择的强调提出了一个关于行为设计的问题。如果我们的行为是为我们设计的，那么设计师要对谁负责呢？这就是福格的另一位前学生特里斯坦-哈里斯希望大家思考的问题。"BJ 创立了行为设计领域，"他告诉我。"但他对其中的道德问题没有答案。这就是我在寻找的东西。"

Harris was Mike Krieger’s collaborator on Send the Sunshine in Fogg’s class of 2006. Like Krieger, Harris went on to create a real-world app, Apture, which was designed to give instant explanations of complex concepts to online readers: a box would pop up when the user held their mouse over a term they wanted explaining. Apture had some success without ever quite taking off, and in 2011 Google acquired Harris’s startup.  

哈里斯是迈克-克里格在 2006 年福格班上的《发送阳光》的合作者。与克里格一样，哈里斯继续创建了一个现实世界的应用程序 Apture，旨在为在线读者提供复杂概念的即时解释：当用户将鼠标放在他们想要解释的术语上时，会弹出一个方框。Apture 取得了一些成功，但并没有完全起飞，2011 年，谷歌收购了哈里斯的创业公司。

The money was nice but it felt like a defeat. Harris believed in his mission to explain, yet he could not persuade publishers that incorporating his app would lead to people spending more time on their sites. He came to believe that the internet’s potential to inform and enlighten was at loggerheads with the commercial imperative to seize and hold the attention of users by any means possible. “The job of these companies is to hook people, and they do that by hijacking our psychological vulnerabilities.”  

钱是不错，但感觉是一种失败。哈里斯相信他的解释使命，但他无法说服出版商，让他们相信加入他的应用程序会让人们在他们的网站上花费更多时间。他开始相信，互联网提供信息和启迪的潜力与通过任何可能的手段抓住和保持用户注意力的商业需要是对立的。"这些公司的工作是吸引人们，他们通过劫持我们的心理弱点来做到这一点"。

Facebook gives your new profile photo a special prominence in the news feeds of your friends, because it knows that this is a moment when you are vulnerable to social approval, and that “likes” and comments will draw you in repeatedly. LinkedIn sends you an invitation to connect, which gives you a little rush of dopamine – how important I must be! – even though that person probably clicked unthinkingly on a menu of suggested contacts. Unconscious impulses are transformed into social obligations, which compel attention, which is sold for cash.  

脸书在你朋友的新闻提要中给你的新资料照片一个特别的突出位置，因为它知道这是你容易受到社会认可的时刻，"喜欢 "和评论会反复吸引你。LinkedIn 会向你发出连接邀请，这让你有一点多巴胺的冲动--我一定是多么重要！尽管那个人可能没有点击过！- 尽管那个人可能不假思索地点击了推荐联系人的菜单。无意识的冲动被转化为社会义务，这迫使人们关注，而关注被卖成了现金。

After working for Google for a year or so, Harris resigned in order to pursue research into the ethics of the digital economy. “I wanted to know what responsibility comes with the ability to influence the psychology of a billion people? What’s the Hippocratic oath?” Before leaving, he gave a farewell presentation to Google’s staff in which he argued that they needed to see themselves as moral stewards of the attention of billions of people. Unexpectedly, the slides from his talk became a viral hit inside the company, travelling all the way to the boardroom. Harris was persuaded to stay on and pursue his research at Google, which created a new job title for him: design ethicist and product philosopher.  

在为谷歌工作了一年多之后，哈里斯辞职，以便对数字经济的伦理问题进行研究。"我想知道影响 10 亿人的心理的能力带来了什么责任？希波克拉底誓言是什么？"在离开之前，他给谷歌的员工做了一个告别演讲，他认为他们需要把自己看作是数十亿人注意力的道德管家。出乎意料的是，他演讲中的幻灯片在公司内部成为病毒式传播，一直传播到董事会。哈里斯被说服留在谷歌继续他的研究，这为他创造了一个新的工作头衔：设计伦理学家和产品哲学家。

After a while, Harris realised that although his colleagues were listening politely, they would never take his message seriously without pressure from the outside. He left Google for good earlier this year to become a writer and advocate, on a mission to wake the world up to how digital technology is diminishing the human capacity for making free choices. “Behaviour design can seem lightweight, because it’s mostly just clicking on screens. But what happens when you magnify that into an entire global economy? Then it becomes about power.”  

一段时间后，哈里斯意识到，虽然他的同事在礼貌地倾听，但如果没有来自外部的压力，他们永远不会认真对待他的信息。今年早些时候，他永远地离开了谷歌，成为一名作家和倡导者，他的使命是唤醒世界，让人们了解数字技术是如何削弱人类做出自由选择的能力的。"行为设计看起来很轻，因为它主要是在屏幕上点击。但是，当你把它放大到整个全球经济时会发生什么？然后它就变成了权力的问题。

Harris talks fast and with an edgy intensity. One of his mantras is, “Whoever controls the menu controls the choices.” The news we see, the friends we hear from, the jobs we hear about, the restaurants we consider, even our potential romantic partners – all of them are, increasingly, filtered through a few widespread apps, each of which comes with a menu of options. That gives the menu designer enormous power. As any restaurateur, croupier or marketer can tell you, options can be tilted to influence choices. Pick one of these three prices, says the retailer, knowing that at least 70% of us will pick the middle one.  

哈里斯说话很快，而且有一种前卫的强度。他的格言之一是："谁控制了菜单，谁就控制了选择。"我们看到的新闻，我们听到的朋友，我们听到的工作，我们考虑的餐馆，甚至我们潜在的浪漫伴侣--所有这些都越来越多地通过一些广泛的应用程序进行过滤，每个应用程序都有一个选项的菜单。这给了菜单设计者巨大的权力。正如任何餐馆老板、赌徒或营销人员可以告诉你的那样，选项可以被倾斜以影响选择。零售商说，从这三个价格中挑选一个，因为他们知道我们中至少有 70%的人会选择中间的那个。

Harris’s peers have, he says, become absurdly powerful, albeit by accident. Menus used by billions of people are designed by a small group of men, aged between 25 and 35, who studied computer science and live in San Francisco. “What’s the moral operating system running in their head?” Harris asks. “Are they thinking about their ethical responsibility? Do they even have the time to think about it?”  

他说，哈里斯的同行们已经变得荒谬地强大，尽管是意外。几十亿人使用的菜单是由一小群人设计的，他们的年龄在 25 到 35 岁之间，学习计算机科学，住在旧金山。"他们头脑中运行的道德操作系统是什么？"哈里斯问道。"他们是否在思考自己的道德责任？他们甚至有时间去思考这个问题吗？"

The more influence that tech products exert over our behaviour, the less control we have over ourselves. “Companies say, we’re just getting better at giving people what they want. But the average person checks their phone 150 times a day. Is each one a conscious choice? No. Companies are getting better at getting people to make the choices they want them to make.”  

科技产品对我们的行为施加的影响越大，我们对自己的控制就越少。"公司说，我们只是越来越善于给人们提供他们想要的东西。但是，普通人每天要检查他们的手机 150 次。每一次都是有意识的选择吗？不是。公司越来越善于让人们做出他们希望他们做出的选择。

**In “Addiction by** **Design**”, her remarkable study of machine gambling in Las Vegas, Natasha Dow Schüll, an anthropologist, quotes an anonymous contributor to a website for recovering addicts. “Slot machines are just Skinner boxes for people! Why they keep you transfixed is not really a big mystery. The machine is designed to do just that.” The gambling industry is a pioneer of behaviour design. Slot machines, in particular, are built to exploit the compelling power of variable rewards. The gambler pulls the lever without knowing what she will get or whether she will win anything at all, and that makes her want to pull it again.  

在 "Addiction byDesign "中，她对拉斯维加斯的机器赌博进行了出色的研究，人类学家 Natasha Dow Schüll 引用了一个康复者网站的匿名贡献者的话。"老虎机只是人们的斯金纳箱！为什么它们让你目不转睛？它们为什么让你目不转睛，其实并不是什么大谜团。机器的设计就是为了做这个。"赌博业是行为设计的先驱者。特别是老虎机，是为了利用可变奖励的强制力而建造的。赌徒在不知道她会得到什么或是否会赢得任何东西的情况下拉动杠杆，这使她想再次拉动杠杆。

The capacity of slot machines to keep people transfixed is now the engine of Las Vegas’s economy. Over the last 20 years, roulette wheels and craps tables have been swept away to make space for a new generation of machines: no longer mechanical contraptions (they have no lever), they contain complex computers produced in collaborations between software engineers, mathematicians, script writers and graphic artists.  

老虎机让人目不转睛的能力现在是拉斯维加斯的经济引擎。在过去的 20 年里，轮盘和骰子桌被扫地出门，为新一代的机器腾出了空间：它们不再是机械装置（它们没有杠杆），而是包含了由软件工程师、数学家、脚本作家和图形艺术家合作生产的复杂计算机。

The casinos aim to maximise what they call “time-on-device”. The environment in which the machines sit is designed to keep people playing. Gamblers can order drinks and food from the screen. Lighting, decor, noise levels, even the way the machines smell – everything is meticulously calibrated. Not just the brightness, but also the angle of the lighting is deliberate: research has found that light drains gamblers’ energy fastest when it hits their foreheads.  

赌场的目标是最大限度地提高他们所谓的 "设备使用时间"。机器所处的环境是为了让人们继续游戏。赌客可以从屏幕上订购饮料和食物。照明、装饰、噪音水平，甚至机器的气味--一切都经过了精心的校准。不仅是亮度，而且照明的角度也是经过深思熟虑的：研究发现，当光线照射到赌徒的额头时，他们的能量消耗得最快。

But it is the variation in rewards that is the key to time-on-device. The machines are programmed to create near misses: winning symbols appear just above or below the “payline” far more often than chance alone would dictate. The player’s losses are thus reframed as potential wins, motivating her to try again. Mathematicians design payout schedules to ensure that people keep playing while they steadily lose money. Alternative schedules are matched to different types of players, with differing appetites for risk: some gamblers are drawn towards the possibility of big wins and big losses, others prefer a drip-feed of little payouts (as a game designer told Schüll, “Some people want to be bled slowly”). The mathematicians are constantly refining their models and experimenting with new ones, wrapping their formulae around the contours of the cerebral cortex.  

但是，奖励的变化才是时间-设备的关键。机器被编程为创造近乎失误的机会：中奖符号出现在 "支付线 "之上或之下的次数远远超过机会本身所决定的。因此，玩家的损失被重塑为潜在的胜利，激励她再次尝试。数学家设计了赔付时间表，以确保人们在不断输钱的同时继续玩下去。不同的时间表与不同类型的玩家相匹配，他们对风险的胃口各不相同：一些赌徒被大赢大输的可能性所吸引，而另一些人则喜欢滴水不漏的小规模赔付（正如一位游戏设计师告诉舒尔的那样，"有些人希望慢慢被放血"）。数学家们不断完善他们的模型，并试验新的模型，将他们的公式包裹在大脑皮层的轮廓上。

Gamblers themselves talk about “the machine zone”: a mental state in which their attention is locked into the screen in front of them, and the rest of the world fades away. “You’re in a trance,” one gambler explains to Schüll. “The zone is like a magnet,” says another. “It just pulls you in and holds you there.”  

赌徒们自己也谈到了 "机器区"：一种精神状态，他们的注意力被锁定在面前的屏幕上，而世界的其他部分则逐渐消失。一位赌徒向舒尔解释说："你处于一种恍惚状态"。"这个区域就像一块磁铁，"另一位说。"它只是把你拉进去，把你留在那里。"

A player who is feeling frustrated and considering quitting for the day might receive a tap on the shoulder from a “luck ambassador”, dispensing tickets to shows or gambling coupons. What the player doesn’t know is that data from his game-playing has been fed into an algorithm that calculates how much that player can lose and still feel satisfied, and how close he is to the “pain point”. The offer of a free meal at the steakhouse converts his pain into pleasure, refreshing his motivation to carry on.  

一个感到沮丧并考虑退出的玩家可能会收到一个 "运气大使 "的拍打肩膀，分发演出门票或赌博优惠券。玩家不知道的是，他的游戏数据已经被输入到一个算法中，该算法计算出该玩家能输多少而仍然感到满意，以及他离 "痛点 "有多近。牛排餐厅提供的免费餐点将他的痛苦转化为快乐，使他重新有动力继续下去。

Schüll’s book, which was published in 2013, won applause for its exposure of the dark side of machine gambling. But some readers spotted opportunities in it. Schüll told me that she received an approach from an online education company interested in adopting the idea of “luck ambassadors”. Where is the pain point for a student who isn’t getting the answers right, and what does she need to get over it instead of giving up? Schüll found herself invited to speak at conferences attended by marketers and entrepreneurs, including one on habit formation organised by Nir Eyal.  

舒尔的书于 2013 年出版，因其揭露了机器赌博的黑暗面而赢得了掌声。但一些读者发现了其中的机会。舒尔告诉我，她收到了一家在线教育公司的邀请，该公司有意采用 "运气大使 "的理念。一个没有答对的学生的痛点在哪里，她需要什么来克服它而不是放弃？Schüll 发现自己被邀请在营销人员和企业家参加的会议上发言，包括由 Nir Eyal 组织的关于习惯形成的会议。

Las Vegas is a microcosm. “The world is turning into this giant Skinner box for the self,” Schüll told me. “The experience that is being designed for in banking or health care is the same as in Candy Crush. It’s about looping people into these flows of incentive and reward. Your coffee at Starbucks, your education software, your credit card, the meds you need for your diabetes. Every consumer interface is becoming like a slot machine.”  

拉斯维加斯是一个缩影。"世界正在变成这个巨大的自我斯金纳箱，"Schüll 告诉我。"在银行或医疗保健中设计的体验与 Candy Crush 相同。它是关于将人们纳入这些激励和奖励的流程中。你在星巴克的咖啡，你的教育软件，你的信用卡，你的糖尿病需要的药物。每一个消费界面都变得像老虎机。"

These days, of course, we all carry slot machines in our pockets.  
当然，这些天，我们的口袋里都装着老虎机。

**Natasha Dow Schüll** accepted her invitation to speak at Eyal’s conference. “It was strange. Nobody in that room wanted to be addicting anyone – they were hipsters from San Francisco, after all. Nice people. But at the same time, their charter is to hook people for startups.” Tristan Harris thinks most people in the world of technology are unwilling to confront the inherent tension in what they do. “Nir and BJ are nice guys. But they overestimate the extent to which they’re empowering people, as opposed to helping to hook them.”  

娜塔莎-道-舒尔接受了她的邀请，在埃亚尔的会议上发言。"这很奇怪。在那个房间里没有人想让任何人上瘾--他们毕竟是来自旧金山的潮人。是好人。但与此同时，他们的章程是为初创企业勾引人。"特里斯坦-哈里斯认为，科技界的大多数人都不愿意面对他们所做的事情中固有的张力。"Nir 和 BJ 是好人。但他们高估了他们赋予人们权力的程度，而不是帮助他们上钩"。

Silicon Valley is bathed in sunshine. The people who work there are optimists who believe in the power of their products to extend human potential. Like Fogg, Eyal sincerely wants to make the world better. “I get almost religious about product design. Product-makers have the ability to improve people’s lives, to find the points when people are in pain, and help them.” He rejects the idea that trying to hook people is inherently dubious. “Habits can be good or bad, and technology has the ability to create healthy habits. If the products are getting better at drawing you in, that’s not a problem: that’s progress.”  

硅谷沐浴在阳光下。在那里工作的人都是乐观主义者，他们相信他们的产品有能力扩展人类的潜力。像福格一样，埃亚尔真诚地希望让世界变得更好。"我对产品设计近乎虔诚。产品制造商有能力改善人们的生活，找到人们处于痛苦中的点，并帮助他们"。他拒绝了试图勾引人们的想法，认为其本质上是可疑的。"习惯可以是好的，也可以是坏的，而技术有能力创造健康的习惯。如果产品在吸引你方面越来越好，这不是一个问题：这就是进步。"

The gambling executives Schüll interviewed were not evil. They believe they are simply offering customers more and better ways to get what they want. Nobody was being coerced or deceived into parting with their money. As one executive put it, in a coincidental echo of Fogg, “You can’t make people do something they don’t want to do.” But the relationship, as Schüll points out, is asymmetric. For the gamblers, the zone is an end in itself; for the gambling industry, it is a means of extracting profit.  

Schüll 采访的赌博业高管们并不邪恶。他们认为，他们只是在为顾客提供更多更好的方式来获得他们想要的东西。没有人被胁迫或欺骗而放弃他们的钱。正如一位高管所说的那样，他不约而同地呼应了福格的话，"你不能让人们做他们不想做的事情"。但正如舒尔所指出的，这种关系是不对称的。对于赌徒来说，赌区本身就是一个目的；对于赌博业来说，它是获取利润的一种手段。

Tristan Harris sees the entire digital economy in similar terms. No matter how useful the products, the system itself is tilted in favour of its designers. The house always wins. “There is a fundamental conflict between what people need and what companies need,” he explained. Harris isn’t suggesting that tech companies are engaged in a nefarious plot to take over our minds – Google and Apple didn’t set out to make phones like slot machines. But the imperative of the system is to maximise time-on-device, and it turns out the best way of doing that is to dispense rewards to the operant on a variable schedule.  

特里斯坦-哈里斯从类似的角度看待整个数字经济。无论产品多么有用，系统本身都是向设计者倾斜的。房子总是赢家。"人们的需求和公司的需求之间存在着根本的冲突，"他解释说。哈里斯并不是说科技公司参与了一个邪恶的阴谋来接管我们的思想--谷歌和苹果并没有打算让手机像老虎机一样。但该系统的当务之急是最大限度地延长使用设备的时间，而事实证明，做到这一点的最佳方法是按可变时间表向操作者发放奖励。

It also means shutting the door to the box. Things that aren’t important to a person are bound up with things that are very important: the machine on which you play games and read celebrity gossip is the one on which you’ll find out if your daughter has fallen ill. So you can’t turn it off or leave it behind. Besides, you might miss a magic moment on Instagram.  

这也意味着关闭盒子的门。对一个人来说不重要的东西与非常重要的东西捆绑在一起：你在上面玩游戏和阅读名人八卦的机器，就是你要在上面发现你女儿是否已经生病的机器。所以你不能把它关掉，也不能把它丢在一边。此外，你可能会错过 Instagram 上的一个神奇时刻。

“There are people who worry about ai \[artificial intelligence\],” Harris said. “They ask whether we can maximise its potential without harming human interests. But ai is already here. It’s called the internet. We’ve unleashed this black box which is always developing new ways to persuade us to do things, by moving us from one trance to the next.”  

"有的人担心 ai\[人工智能\]，"哈里斯说。"他们问我们是否能在不损害人类利益的情况下最大限度地发挥其潜力。但是 ai 已经在这里了。它被称为互联网。我们已经释放了这个黑匣子，它总是在开发新的方法来说服我们做事情，把我们从一个恍惚的状态转移到下一个。"

In theory, we can all opt out of the loops of incentive and reward which encircle us, but few of us choose to. It is just so much easier to accept and connect. If we are captives of captology, then we are willing ones.  

从理论上讲，我们都可以选择退出包围我们的激励和奖励的循环，但我们中很少有人选择这样做。接受和连接是如此的容易。如果我们是俘虏学的俘虏，那么我们是自愿的。
